	<p><h4>
Baptism is a public display of one's profession in Jesus Christ and commitment to walk in the new nature.

    I was once involved in a denomination that believed that a person had to get baptized in order to go to heaven. I now know that that is a lie. Let me ask you a question. If someone was in the middle of the desert and called on Jesus Christ to be their savior, do you think God would save them? Yes, in fact he tells us in Acts 31 and Romans (for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved). If that hypothetical man was not saved by believing on Christ as Moses and the children of Israel looked upon the serpent and were healed, then salvation would not be of faith; it would be based upon the "work" of baptism. Yes, pretty much every New Testament character was baptized, but I can name one person that was saved by faith who was not baptized; the thief on the cross.
