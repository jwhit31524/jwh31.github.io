	<p><h4>
Jesus Christ is the Son of God. I do find it interesting that people use the name of Jesus Christ when they curse.
    Why do they use that name out of all the names that have existed in the world? As the classic hymn states,
    there is something about that name. It is real. It is powerful. Jesus Christ is real.
